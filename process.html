    <div id="explanation">
        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <h5>To plan this website I used Figma and created the pages that I based the website on. I wanted to create a simplistic
            and minimalistic website style to avoid unnecessary visual elements that may overwhelm and distract the user. This is 
            why I opted for a softer and lighter background as opposed to a background image or a brightly colored background. For the footer, I chose
            to use a dark blue, one of my favorite colors, which also fits well within the aesthetic of the site. Furthermore, I seperated 
            each section on every page with some padding and headings to clearly show the end and start of each section.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            I decided to repurpose my navbar from a previous assignment and adjust it to fit well within the style of my site since 
            I liked the functionality and thought it would act as an adequate navbar.
        </h5>
        <h4>Logo</h4>
        <h5>As I have used this logo in my previous portfolio website I decided to use it again here. I feel as though this is a great logo for my personal 
            site as it fits my minimalistic aesthetic and represents me.
        </h5>
        <h4>Accessibility</h4>
        <h5>By using the WAVE evaluation tool I was able to ensure this site's pages were WCAG 2.0 compliant and text or any interactable element
            had sufficient contrast and is readable for a wide range of users. I also made sure that each image had an alt tag to further increase the accessibility 
            of the site.
        </h5>
        <h4>Navigation</h4>
        <h5>Structural: The structural navigation represents the website's hierarchy which allows users to quickly and easily navigate through the site.
            The structural navigation includes each page - home, about, gallery, contact, blog, resume, process. 
        </h5>
        <h5>Associative: This navigation type is used to make connections between different pages that have similar information. For example,
             both experience and education are linked through the resume page.
        </h5>
        <h5>Utility: This navigation refers to the tools available to the user to help them navogate through the site more smoothly. The logo in the navbar and 
            footer brings users to the home page when clicked, allowing them to have access to the home page wherever they are in the site.
